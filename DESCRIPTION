Description: 
    This package contain raw data files processed from transcriptome sequencing 
of individual cells extracted from mouse visual cortex. Aligned reads (BAM) from cells 
grouped into each of the four cell clusters (GABAergic, Glutamatergic, Non-neuronal, Endothelial) 
were merged and transcripts were assembled using StringTie assembler. Refseq chromosome IDs
were converted into Ensembl IDs.
